\section{Code implementation}
\label{sec:code}
\textcolor{red}{The complete code used in this work has been made publicly accessible. That is, the implementation of the strategy but also all the code use to create and estimate the factor models, to obtain the alphas for the quarterly regressions, to study the performance of the strategy, etc. Even the latex version of this written document has been made accessible. All that code can be accessed via GitHub at \href{https://github.com/fcelya/long-short-pnl-drivers}{https://github.com/fcelya/long-short-pnl-drivers}. The only elements that have not been made accessible are the datasets used to run the strategy and to estimate the factor parameters. They could not be uploaded due to GitHub's limitations, and enough information has been given in \autoref{sec:data-description} for anyone to be able to recreate those datasets. \\ The hope is that by making this code easily accessible, more people will be tempted to explore it, play with it and the ideas presented in this work can be further explored by the community at large. }
