\section{Results}
After having described all the different implemented models, having formulated a hypothesis about which should be able to outperformed and explained how the models are trained and evaluated, it is now time to present and analyze the obtained results. This section will have four subsection. The first three will focus on each of the three capacity factors, analyzing separately which models outperform and why in each of them. The final section will be devoted to analyzing whether the custom loss function successfully outperforms the base loss function in extreme value modeling.
